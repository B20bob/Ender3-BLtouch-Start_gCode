# Ender3-BLtouch-Start_gCode
Custom start gCode for Ender 3 / Ender 3 Pro / Ender Extender 400xl with BLtouch and Marlin 1.9..  Homes axis', Heats bed, Probes bed, then heats nozzle. The intention is to avoid oozing plastic onto the bed while probing (especially TPU).

This is just a place for me to store this code in case I ever need it in the future. If anyone else finds it helpful, of course you can feel free to use it as well.


# Ender3-End_gCode
Custom End gCode for Ender 3 / Ender 3 Pro / Ender Extender 400xl which extracts filament at beginning of end gCode sequence.
